# Detailed Logarithmic Timeline

In January 2025, my favorite Wikipedia article, *Detailed Logarithmic Timeline*
[was deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Detailed_logarithmic_timeline").
This is remake of the article as it was on 2025-01-24,
the last time it was saved by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
